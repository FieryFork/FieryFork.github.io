# My Music
I make electronic music for fun to mimic the style of [Kelly Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Bailey_(composer))
<br>
This is the current cover for my album titled Antiquated Beat (it's not a real error):<br>

This is my peice titled *Mori in Conatu* meaning *Die Trying*. I hope to use it in a game someday. I composed the score and arranged it.

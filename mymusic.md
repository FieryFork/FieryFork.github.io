# My Music
I make electronic music for fun to mimic the style of [Kelly Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Bailey_(composer)). I use deep synths and electronic tones to make the music sound industrial. I often use echoing drone sound effects to make the music have a certain vibe.

This is the current cover for my album titled Antiquated Beat:<br>

*It's not a real error.*

This is my peice titled *Mori in Conatu* meaning *Die Trying* in Latin. I hope to use it in a game someday. I composed the score and arranged it for the Antiquated Beat album.

# Hammer
*[Return Home](index.md)*<br><br>
I am a very  active Hammer Mapping Community member. At the time of this writing,
I am creating a wave defense map with hostile Vortigaunts for Garry's Mod.

### I Love ai_relationship
The hostility of npcs is catered towards Gordon Freeman. If you're a combine soldier, rebels shouldn't help you.
If you're a vortigaunt enslaved by the Nihilanth, you shouln't be attacked by others of your kind. ai_relationship can
change that, adding to the immersion.

### I Hate Hammer Crashes
Whenever Hammer crashes and I lose my progress, I lose all motivation. It just makes me sad.
### Vortigaunts Crash Portal
Fun fact! Vortigaunt particle effects do not exist in Portal's files, resulting in a  crash when they try to attack anything.
### Portal's Engine is a Hybrid
[Portal's](portal.md) engine is a mixture of HL2 Ep. 1's engine and TF2's engine.
### Deathmatch Maps
Deathmatch maps are maps desinged for PvP combat. Deathmatch maps tend to lack the 
puzzle solving elements of other varieties of creations in favor of the satisfying
combat that arises from interesting, dynamic environments.

This addon is the *best* way to play deathmatch maps in Garry's Mod: [Half-Life 2 Deathmatch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557213208) You don't even need friends because there are handy bots!
#### Traversability
Deathmatch maps need to be very traversable. If deathmatch maps aren't traversable, players won't find it fun to participate in combat.
<br>
Here are 4 things you can do to make your map more easily traversable:
- Add more than one door to each room.
- Make it clear what parts of the map are traversable.
- Gamers don't look up. Don't force players to think vertically.
- Make there be visual contrast. Without visual contrast, players will get lost.
<br>
These things can make your map easy to traverse.
#### Combat
Deathmatch maps need to be fun to fight in. Here are 5 tips for making deathmatch maps fun to fight in:
- Add fences. Players can fight through the gaps in fences, but their bodies don't quite make it.
- Add crates or boxes. Players love to hide behind crates or boxes. It makes there be safe spaces in otherwise open maps.
- Make there be windows for players to jump through. Nothing is greater to a player than a sense of freedom. Let them go places they otherwise wouldn't be allowed to.
- Place healthkits in areas that are uncovered. This encourages players to take risks while playing against eachother.
- Put rare weapons in hard to access areas for players to find.
<br>
By using these techniques you csn create novel and fun gameplay content. Remember, if something isn't fun, cut it.

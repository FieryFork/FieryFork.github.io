# Hammer
*[Return Home](index.md)*<br>
I am a very  active Hammer Mapping Community member. At the time of this writing,
I am creating a wave defense map with hostile Vortigaunts for Garry's Mod.
### My Hammer preferences and Why:

| Favorite Point Entity | Favorite Brush Entity | Favorite NPC |
|---|---|---|
| ai_relationship | trigger_autosave | npc_antlion |
| I like this one because I can make hostile NPCs nice and nice NPCs hostile | I like this one for obvious reasons | I like this one for its versatility and unique ability to cause fear |

### I Love ai_relationship
The hostility of npcs is catered towards Gordon Freeman. If you're a combine soldier, rebels shouldn't help you.
If you're a vortigaunt enslaved by the Nihilanth, you shouln't be attacked by others of your kind. ai_relationship can
change that, adding to the immersion.

### I Hate Hammer Crashes
Whenever Hammer crashes and I lose my progress, I lose all motivation. It just makes me sad.
### Vortigaunts Crash Portal
Fun fact! Vortigaunt particle effects do not exist in Portal's files, resulting in a  crash when they try to attack anything.
### Portal's Engine is a Hybrid
[Portal's](portal.md) engine is a mixture of HL2 Ep. 1's engine and TF2's engine.
### Deathmatch Maps
Deathmatch maps are maps desinged for PvP combat. Deathmatch maps tend to lack the 
puzzle solving elements of other varieties of creations in favor of the satisfying
combat that arises from interesting, dynamic environments.

This addon is the *best* way to play deathmatch maps in Garry's Mod: [Half-Life 2 Deathmatch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557213208) You don't even need friends because there are handy bots!
#### Traversability
Deathmatch maps need to be very traversable. If deathmatch maps aren't traversable, players won't find it fun to participate in combat.
<br>
Here are 4 things you can do to make your map more easily traversable:
- Add more than one door to each room.
- Make it clear what parts of the map are traversable.
- Gamers don't look up. Don't force players to think vertically.
- Make there be visual contrast. Without visual contrast, players will get lost.
#### Combat
Deathmatch maps need to be fun to fight in. Here are 5 tips for making deathmatch maps fun to fight in:

- Add fences. Players can fight through the gaps in fences, but their bodies don't quite make it.
- Add crates or boxes. Players love to hide behind crates or boxes. It makes there be safe spaces in otherwise open maps.
- Make there be windows for players to jump through. Nothing is greater to a player than a sense of freedom. Let them go places they otherwise wouldn't be allowed to.
- Place healthkits in areas that are uncovered. This encourages players to take risks while playing against eachother.
- Put rare weapons in hard to access areas for players to find.
### Vertigo / Palace
Vertigo was a beta Half-Life 2 map built around a giant castle-like skyscraper. Gordon would have been forced to descend the tower after being forced into it. It would have taken place around the resistance sections of the game with the Overwatch Nexus Building among other things. that I feel like recreating the Vertigo / Palace Half-Life 2 beta levels in Garry's mod. 
It seems like a fun project to take on, due to the jank of the maps involved. They will be quite unfinished, making the end result even more satisfying. 
I want to overhaul the skybox, detail the maps with physics props, and craft novel enemy encounters.

<br>
Imagine this:
<br>
<br>
<center>A giant tower near the center of a sprawling city. It looks over all around it. Inside, the floors are breaking and the walls are tipping as the tedious tower stands high above the rest. One man must make his way through the tower, fighting guards and aliens as he descends the many flights of stairs to the bottom of the monolithic structure.</center>

# Hammer

I am a very  active Hammer Mapping Community member. At the time of this writing,
I am creating a wave defense map with hostile Vortigaunts for Garry's Mod.

### My Hammer preferences and Why:

| Favorite Point Entity | Favorite Brush Entity | Favorite NPC |
|---|---|---|
| ai_relationship | trigger_autosave | npc_antlion |
| I like this one because I can make hostile NPCs nice and nice NPCs hostile | I like this one for obvious reasons | I like this one for its versatility and unique ability to cause fear |

### I Love ai_relationship
The hostility of npcs is catered towards Gordon Freeman. If you're a combine soldier, rebels shouldn't help you.
If you're a vortigaunt enslaved by the Nihilanth, you shouln't be attacked by other free vortigaunts. ai_relationship can
change that, adding to the immersion.

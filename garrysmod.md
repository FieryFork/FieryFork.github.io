I also play Garry's Mod. I enjoy Garry's mod because of its
sandbox elements. Garry's mod also gives me an outlet to
be creative with [Hammer](hammer.md) without the bottlenecks that 
[Portal's](portal.md) buggy engine supplied. Garry's Mod is very good
fun when playing with other people, too. If your installation of
a source engine game is bloated, I recommend G-Mod, as it can help
organize the bloat of the many mods installed in the legendary
*custom* folder.

# Music on a TI-Nspire Clickpad

I have found out that by using the TI-84 Plus SE Keypad on the TI-Nspire Clickpad edition, you can play music off of it using [mobileTunes](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/176/x176). [mobileTunes](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/176/x176) turns your TI-84 Plus into a 4-channel MIDI player with the power of the I/O port located on the calculator. The TI-Nspire Clickpad doesn't support [mobileTunes](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/176/x176), but there is a workaround. The TI-84 Plus SE Keypad allows the TI-Nspire Clickpad to emulate a TI-84 Plus SE. I think you see where I'm going with this.

The first problem is that the I/O port is a 2.5 mm female socket and headphones use 3.5 mm male jacks. The solution: order a 2.5 mm female jack to 3.5 mm socket adapter. The adapter should arrive on Feb 12, 2026.

The part has finally arrived and and I've put together the final project. I installed [mobileTunes](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/176/x176) and have really enjoyed playing with it. The audio quality isn't perfect, but you can put good music on the calculator. Anyway, I think this was a fun project and would recommend it to anyone who has a TI-84 Plus SE or a TI-Nspire Clickpad.

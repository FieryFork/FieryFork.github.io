# Half Life 2
*[Return Home](index.md)*<br>
A masterpiece. What else am I supposed to say? This game has peak story, gameplay. and graphics. Although it is now over twenty years old, it still holds up.
<br>
I will split up my review of this game by its chapters.
### Point Insertion
This chapter has lots of walking. You're shot at by CPs in a later section, but it's impossible to fight back. This chapter doesn't have any compelling gameplay that makes it stand out. Overall, it does a good job of introducing City 17.
### A Red Letter Day
This chapter is just a cutscene. It isn't very enjoyable once you know all of the story beats.
### Route Kanal
Half Life 2's best chapter so far. This chapter is enjoyable to anyone who likes the Half Life 1 gameplay style. You get into many firefights with CPs, this time on an even playing field. There is a lot of red barrel craziness in this chapter. This chapter doesn't have very unique or varied combat, but it is fun combat.
### Water Hazard
This chaprer only deserves to be improved. Ir plays well in the first part, but it's drawn out to an insufferable length. This chapter needs to be abridged. The boat getting stuck on rocks every 5 minutes would be fine if it lasted for 25 minutes. If that were to happen, this chapter would be better than Route Kanal.
### Black Mesa East
Everything I said about A Red Letter Day applies here. You do get to play fetch with dog, so this one's a little better. Overall, the lore is very heavy in this section, and you'll be stuck playing with things for a long time if you're impatient.
### Ravenholm
This chapter is a mixed bag. The gameplay is stellar. The headcrab zombies jumping out only scared me once, but other than that, the scariness of this level _does not_ hold up today. Father Grigori is very likeable. But dang, what kind of _Sweet Home Alabama_ was going on for you to be his brother and him to be your dad. It's very easy to get lost in. I had to search up a video tutorial in a Valve game of all things. This level has excellent gameplay. _(If you can't tell that I'm joking, take things less seriously)_ If the horror was increased and the level was made to be more linear, this level would have a fighting chance against bangers like Route Kanal.
### Highway 17
This chapter is very good. The vehicle sections are great. They don't force any fancy tricks or physics puzzles. There are many nice firefights with excellent gunplay. The "Lighthouse Point" battle is excellent. There are lots of cool secrets and encounters littered throughout the chapter. In conclusion, this chapter is very good, but not Route Kanal good.

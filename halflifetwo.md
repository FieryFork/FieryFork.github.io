# Half Life 2
*[Return Home](index.md)*<br>
A masterpiece. What else am I supposed to say? This game has peak story, gameplay. and graphics. Although it is now over twenty years old, it still holds up.
<br>
I will split up my review of this game by its chapters.
### Point Insertion
This chapter has lots of walking. Overall, it does a good job of introducing City 17.
### A Red Letter Day
This chapter is just a cutscene. It isn't very enjoyable once you know all of the story beats.
### Route Kanal
Half Life 2's best chapter so far. This chapter is enjoyable to anyone who likes the Half Life 1 gameplay style.
### Water Hazard
This chaprer only deserves to be improved. Ir plays well in the first part, but it's drawn out to an insufferable length. This chapter needs to be abridged. If that were to happen, this chapter would be better than Route Kanal.
### Black Mesa East
Everything I said about A Red Letter Day applies here. You do get to play fetch with dog, so this one's a little better.
### Ravenholm
This chapter is a mixed bag. It's very easy to get lost in. I had to search up a video tutorial in a Valve game of all things. This level has excellent gameplay. If the horror was increased and the level was made to be more linear, this level would have a fighting chance against bangers like Route Kanal.

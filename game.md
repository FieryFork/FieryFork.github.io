# Game Design
I take a lot of inspiration from Valve's game design. The show-don't-tell style that many Valve titles use is admirable, considering that many of their IPs are complex. This page will detail the many details that make Valve's game design so incredible.
<br>
<br>
Right off the bat, don't expect designing a game to be easy. It will be *hard*. Good games take lots of time, and rushed ones are bad. To put it in the words of Gabe Newell,
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
To make a game's content feel right, make two games and cut the bad one. In other words, do double what you'd like to, and then scrap any ideas or content that doesn't fit into the better half of the game.
<br>
<br>
Cut similair things from your game. If two features are too similair or one is too niche, cut it. You don't need two of the same thing in a game.
<br>
<br>
Leave some things open to speculation. Little mysteries make a game's world feel more real and open-ended. It lets players speculate as they take in information about your universe.

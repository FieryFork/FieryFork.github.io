# Portal: Crumbs of Truth
*[Return Home](index.md)*<br><br>
Portal: Crumbs of Truth is a [Portal](portal.md) mod that consists of 15 amazing test chambers and an escape sequence.

It follows the story of a test subject in pre-GLaDOS Aperture going through brand new test chambers. The chambers are supervised by a psychologically unstable scientist with a New York Accent and an obsession with cookies guides you. This mod shouldn't be missed out on, for its story and gameplay. In my opinion, it is the best Portal mod available out there.

It keeps the concepts from the original Portal, but also adds common new concepts such as laser walls and numbered cubes. Although it is my favorite mod, 
it has its fair share of Source Engine jank. There's lots of areas where you can softlock, but you have to be trying to become soft locked.

It is extremely satisfying to speedrun through, with plenty of places to use [ABH](portal.md#speedrunning) and other glitches in fun ways. Overall, Portal: Crumbs of Truth 
is a mod that everyone should play.

### My Hammer Experience with Portal
*For the full Hammer article, go [here](hammer.md)*

I have used Hammer in Portal ever since I discovered it in Portal 2's SDK. I had been dissapointed that I couldn't make maps in Portal 1 until I found it. Deep in the files of Portal 1 *This isn't the start of a fantasy novel, I promise* there was a secret. The legendary **Hammer Executable File**! *cue movie intro*

Short story long, I discoveered the files of Half Life 2 inside of Portal 1. I created an arena for fighting Antlions, but they were bugged and made no sound. Unfortunate. Just kidding. I got Garry's Mod and that was that. ðŸ˜„

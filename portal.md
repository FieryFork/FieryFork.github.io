If you need any tips, don't try to ask me, go here:

It's a tutorial on A-Hopping, one of the most effective ways of moving quickly
in Portal 1 and many other source games.
### My Hammer Experience with Portal
*For the full Hammer article, go [here](hammer.md)*

I have used Hammer in Portal ever since I discovered it in Portal 2's SDK. I had been dissapointed that I couldn't make maps in Portal 1 until I found it. Deep in the files of Portal 1 *This isn't the start of a fantasy novel, I promise* there was a secret. The legendary **Hammer Executable File**! *cue movie intro*

Short story long, I discoveered the files of Half Life 2 inside of Portal 1. I created an arena for fighting Antlions, but they were bugged and made no sound. Unfortunate. Just kidding. I got [Garry's Mod](garrysmod.md) and that was that. ðŸ˜„

### The Cut Portal Ending
Portal was originally going to end in Xen. This may have been supposed to imply that Aperture used Xen to make the Portal gun, but it could also imply that Aperture itself was built in Xen. These explanations are just theories and speculation, though.
